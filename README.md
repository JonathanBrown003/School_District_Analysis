# School District Analysis
Pandas to analyze school district data

## Overview of the School District Analysis
We set out to replace inaccurate data for 9th graders at Thomas High School while also performing the same analysis we did during the module in looking at testing and grade data at various schools using Pandas. Factors that were taken into consideration while looking at the data include average math and reading scores, school budget, per capita spending per school, etc. We also looked at the total passing percentage of students along with their aggregate math and reading scores by school. 

## Results
Many of the metrics remained the same due to removing a portion of data for 9th graders at Thomas High School. Removing this data did not drastically skew the district data in the aggregate but it did very slighly affect the aggregate scores for students at Thomas High School. The math and reading scores still averaged approximately 83% before and after scrubbing the data. 

A surprising finding with spending by per capita spending found that the highest average student scores were attained by those schools in the lowest per capita spending bracket (<$584). Please see below:

We also found that charter schools had considerably better student scores across in the board in every category measured:
